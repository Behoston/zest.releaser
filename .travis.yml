before_install:
  - sudo apt-get update
# apt-get update is needed as there's a faulty PPA in use inside travis
# itself, which means we cannot install git-svn. The update fixes it.
  - sudo apt-get install git-svn
# In the line above, really only git-svn is needed as the rest
# is automatically installed. But then again, git-svn used to be
# installed by default, too. So for later reference, you need
# "git bzr mercurial subversion", too.
# Now, we need to upgrade the system distribute, otherwise the
# bootstrap will fail:
  - pip install --upgrade distribute
# Configure git and bazaar:
  - git config --global user.name "Temp user"
  - git config --global user.email "temp@example.com"
  - bzr whoami "Temp user <temp@example.com>"
# Get the versions of the vcs programs, so we have this information in
# case something goes wrong:
  - bzr --version
  - git --version
  - hg --version
  - svn --version
